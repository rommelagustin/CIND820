# CIND820 Predicting Rental Rate Growth in the Canadian Market
RA CIND820-Capstone Project
This project aims to investigate how commercial retail rents in key major cities of Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, Edmonton and Calgary, if population and household income impacts retail rent growth in these select cities
We found from Statistics Canada 4 datasets: 1) Population based on 2006 and 2011 census 2) Population based on 2016 census 3) Household income for 2005 and 2015 and 4) Commercial Rents Price Service Index
Data analyses of datasets: Checking attribute types, statistics (i.e., min, max, mean, std, etc.)
Data analyses of datasets: Review for outliers, visualize with scatter or boxplots and check for correlation and links
Data analyses of datasets: Check if numeric attributes are normal (parametric). Use histogram to see if attibutes have influence
Data preparation: Check if there are missing values, select relevant columns/attributes for the study without reducing 
Data preparation: With separate datasets, relevant attributes are combined and transformed
Data preparation: Combine cleaned datasets, perform similar data analyses as above: attributes check, statistics, outliers and visualization including plots and histograms
Predictive modeling: Use Classification (result from above: identified these are labeled data; do predictive and supervised learning)
Predictive modeling: Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbours compare which performs better
Predictive modeling: Do data split and simple training
Model evaluation: Determine performance measures via confusion matrix: Accuracy, Recall, etc. 
Conclusion
Repository to contain raw datasets, word document file of analyses (i.e., statistics, visualizations, correlations, etc.), predictive modeling and model evaluation
